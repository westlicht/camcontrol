/*****************************************************************************
* NOTE01:
* Cortex-M3 does not lock interrupts upon the interrupt entry, so interrupts
* can nest. You can prevent interrupts from nesting by setting the priorities
* of all interrupts to the same level. In this case, you could undefine
* the QF_ISR_NEST macro. Either way, you don't need to change the macros
* QK_ISR_ENTRY()/QK_ISR_EXIT().
*
* NOTE02:
* The QK_ISR_EXIT() macro triggers the Cortex-M3 PendSV exception, which
* in turn causes QK_schedule_() to run. The PendSV exception is prioritized
* lower than all interrupts in the system, so the NVIC performs tail-chaining
* to PendSV only after all nested interrupts are handled. This means that
* in Cortex-M3 you don't need to increment and decrement the nesting level
* QK_intNest_, because it doesn't matter for the tail-chaining mechanism.

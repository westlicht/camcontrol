<h1><a class="anchor" name="derivation">Encapsulation and Single Inheritance in C </a></h1>Inheritance is the ability to derive new structures based on existing structures in order to reuse and organize code. You can implement single inheritance in C very simply by literally embedding the base structure as the first member of the derived structure. For example, <a class="el" href="derivation.html#FA1">Figure 1</a>(a) shows the structure ScoreEvt derived from the base structure <a class="el" href="struct_q_event.html" title="Event structure.">QEvent</a> by embedding the <a class="el" href="struct_q_event.html" title="Event structure.">QEvent</a> instance as the first member of ScoreEvt. To make this idiom better stand out, I always name the base structure member super.<p>

<p><strong>Figure 1 (a) Derivation of structures in C, (b) memory alignment, and (c) the UML class diagram.</strong></p></div>
 As shown in <a class="el" href="derivation.html#FA1">Figure 1</a>(b), such nesting of structures always aligns the data member super at the beginning of every instance of the derived structure. In particular, this alignment lets you treat a pointer to the derived ScoreEvt structure as a pointer to the <a class="el" href="struct_q_event.html" title="Event structure.">QEvent</a> base structure. Consequently, you can always safely pass a pointer to ScoreEvt to any C function that expects a pointer to <a class="el" href="struct_q_event.html" title="Event structure.">QEvent</a>. (To be strictly correct in C, you should explicitly cast this pointer. In OOP such casting is called upcasting and is always safe.) Therefore, all functions designed for the <a class="el" href="struct_q_event.html" title="Event structure.">QEvent</a> structure are automatically available to the ScoreEvt structure as well as other structures derived from <a class="el" href="struct_q_event.html" title="Event structure.">QEvent</a>. <a class="el" href="derivation.html#FA1">Figure 1</a>(c) shows the UML class diagram depicting the inheritance relationship between ScoreEvt and <a class="el" href="struct_q_event.html" title="Event structure.">QEvent</a> structures.<p>
QP uses single inheritance quite extensively not just for derivation of events with parameters, but also for derivation of state machines and active objects. Of course, the C++ version of QP uses the native C++ support for class inheritance rather than "derivation of structures".<p>
